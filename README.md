# Social Authentication

## Overview

The **social-authentication** project aims to establish a secure and seamless login connection between our application and various social media platforms, including GitHub, Google, Facebook, and Apple. By integrating social login, users can easily access our app without the need to create a new account, thereby enhancing user experience and engagement.

## Objectives

- **Simplified User Experience:** Allow users to log in using their existing social media accounts, reducing the friction of account creation and password management.
- **Enhanced Security:** Utilize the OAuth 2.0 protocol to provide a secure authentication mechanism that leverages the security features of established social media platforms.
- **Broad Accessibility:** Cater to a wide audience by supporting multiple social media providers, accommodating users with different preferences.

## Supported Providers

- **GitHub**: Enable users to log in with their GitHub accounts, facilitating access for developers and tech-savvy individuals.
- **Google**: Provide login options through Google accounts, which is widely used and trusted by many users.
- **Facebook**: Integrate Facebook login to reach a large user base and leverage social sharing features. (Unauthorized)
- **Apple**: Support Apple ID login for users within the Apple ecosystem, promoting privacy and security. (Unauthorized)
